<blockquote>
<p><i>April, 1894</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>We rode along and finally Montezuma
Castle loomed up.... I was very much
excited and filled with awe.  We
just sat and gazed.  Finally I got
my little wooden camera out and
took a picture of the Castle from
horseback.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="c1">The Settlers</h3>
<p>Many early visitors thought this cliff dwelling was a
&ldquo;castle&rdquo; built by Aztec refugees for their emperor,
Montezuma&mdash;thus the name!</p>
<h3 id="c2">Today</h3>
<p>Thanks to the archeologist, a more realistic story is
beginning to unfold. The setting is a prehistoric one,
meaning the people involved left no written history.
They are believed to be the ancestors of some
present-day Southwestern Indians.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">Montezuma Castle</span></h2>
<h3 id="c4">Time A.D. 1100-1400</h3>
<p>This 20-room apartment house was occupied between 1100
and 1400. It has approximately the same floor space as a
large, three-bedroom home of today. Perhaps a dozen
families, or about 50 people, lived here.</p>
<h3 id="c5">A natural recess provides shelter</h3>
<p>Like other nearby caves and crevasses, the large recess in
which the Castle was built is the product of wind and water
erosion over eons of time. Shelter from the elements and
solar heat from the winter sun were probably good reasons
for starting a home here. Other ideas have also been
suggested, including protection, tradition, or perhaps the
view! However, with no written records to guide us, maybe
the real reasons will never be known.</p>
<h3 id="c6">300 years of construction</h3>
<p>The uppermost wall of the Castle was apparently the first
one constructed. It makes two rooms out of a cave in the
highest part of the recess. Later additions were made in
front of and below these rooms. It appears that
modifications were made right up to the time of
abandonment!</p>

<h3 id="c8">Today</h3>
<p>Because of the natural overhang and quality of
construction, Montezuma Castle stands today as
a well-preserved cliff dwelling.</p>

<h3 id="c9">Say Ranger!</h3>
<p>The following
are some
frequently
asked
questions
about
Montezuma
Castle</p>
<p>HOW DID THEY GET UP THERE?
Probably ladders. Although none
were found here, remains of
ladders have been found at other
prehistoric sites.  Are there any
materials around here from which
they could make ladders?
Sycamore and Ash are abundant
along the fertile riverbed of nearby
Beaver Creek.</p>
<p>THESE PEOPLE HAD NO WRITTEN HISTORY.
HOW THEN DO WE KNOW ABOUT THEIR LIVES
AND TIMES? The large mound at the base of the cliff
contains over three centuries of trash discarded by the
cliff dwellers above. As the layers of food-remains,
wornout tools and broken pottery accumulated, an
unwritten history of the lives and times of these people
was provided. What will our dumps and landfills &ldquo;tell&rdquo;
future archeologists about our lifestyles?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>WHY CAN&rsquo;T WE GO UP THERE?
Montezuma Castle is irreplaceable!
Most of the structure is over 600
years old and once housed about
50 people. Nearly one-half million
people now view this ruin yearly. If
the Castle had been open to
visitors last year, what would be
left for you to enjoy?</p>
<p>ARE THESE OPENINGS AN ENTRANCE TO THE CASTLE?
No! These two small caves were
probably used for food storage.
Being high and dry, such walled-up
openings were excellent places to
store staples.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">Not So Obvious</span></h2>
<h3 id="c11">High and Dry</h3>
<p>Slightly lower and to the west of the castle, there once
stood an 8- or 9-room dwelling. Over the centuries natural
weathering has reduced this structure to a pile of rocks
and dust. Perhaps the people who built in the cliffs chose
this site because they understood desert creeks.
Occasionally, the flats below are covered by floodwaters.</p>
<h3 id="c12">For the future</h3>
<p>This ruin has never been excavated. Wouldn&rsquo;t doing so add
to our knowledge of its occupants? Probably. But instead of
calling in the archeologists today, why not leave this site
undisturbed for a while longer? Archeology is a relatively
new science and its techniques are continually being
developed and refined. Could the information buried here
be of greater value in the future?</p>

<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">A Day In Their Life</span></h2>
<h3 id="c14">Castle &lsquo;A&rsquo;</h3>
<p>West of Montezuma Castle, at the base of the cliff, is
Castle A. In 1934 the ruin was excavated by archeologists.
This &ldquo;dig&rdquo; provided insight into the lives of the families who
called it home. Let&rsquo;s step back in time and join the
archeologists in a few of these discoveries....</p>
<h3 id="c15">Abandoned belongings</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="795" height="593" />
<p class="pcap">An abandoned room</p>
</div>
<p>In one room, scattered here and there were corncobs,
squash stems, beans, and the remains of several stone
hoes. A large clay storage pot was found in the right rear
corner. By its side, a food grinder was propped up and
ready for use. Did we discover the remains of a farmer&rsquo;s
home?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h3 id="c16">Tragedy</h3>
<p>Buried in the room directly behind and above the preceding
one were the remains of three infants. The Hopi Indians of
northern Arizona believe in burying a child near the
mother so that its spirit may enter another newborn. Does
the discovery of these burials shed light on the spiritual
beliefs of the parents?</p>
<h3 id="c17">Clever housekeeping</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p05a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="365" />
<p class="pcap">Clay pot</p>
</div>
<p>In a room to the left of
the child burials a large
clay pot was found
propped against a firepit.
Was this arrangement
accidental? Or, did some
prehistoric housekeeper
devise a method for
keeping water hot?</p>
<h3 id="c18">A touch of elegance</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p05b.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="395" />
<p class="pcap">Cloth with patterns and fringe</p>
</div>
<p>The caves above contained
woven material. Many were
made from wild plant fibers
for day-to-day use&mdash;sandals,
skirts, matting, and rope.
Other items were woven
from cotton, a cultivated
&ldquo;crop.&rdquo; Some of these fabrics
were of dyed yarn and made
into intricate designs. Today,
weaving is considered an art.
Would these prehistoric
people agree?</p>
<h3 id="c19">... And Death</h3>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">The Burials Reveal</span></h2>
<h3 id="c21">Trading</h3>
<p>Material goods are frequently found with human remains.
Examine the pictures on these pages. These items were
discovered with one of the female burials. The pendant and
decorated bowl indicate that these people were part of an
extensive trading network which covered at least the
length and breadth of the Southwest.</p>
<h3 id="c22">Rigors of life</h3>
<p>Of the fifteen skeletons whose ages could be determined,
eleven died before age 45. Some skeletons also provided
evidence of arthritis and other bone diseases. And as noted
in the archeological report, &ldquo;... two male skulls showed ...
several straight, ragged cuts such as could have been
caused by a blunt stone axe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="494" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The DECORATED BOWL

</div>
<h3 id="c23">Customs</h3>
<p>The backs of over half the skulls were flattened! This could
have occurred because infants were often strapped to rigid
cradleboards. Whether this deformation was intentional or
not is debatable.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="Beaver Creek" width="800" height="582" />
</div>
<p>Beaver Creek flows regardless
of the season! Most of
the time it is gentle and clear.
However, dry periods may
reduce streamflow to a trickle
hidden beneath the rocky
creekbed. Limbs and twigs
are often lodged in the trees
along the creek. This debris
is evidence of the power and
height of rampaging flood
waters. The cliff dwellers
probably knew and accepted
all these moods.</p>
<p>Directly across the creek,
buried beneath years of river
deposits, are remnants of
prehistoric irrigation ditches.
They were used to carry
creek water into cultivated
fields of corn, beans, squash
and cotton.</p>
<p>These farmers also gathered
the wild plants and hunted the
animals along this streamside.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for animals!
Bones of deer, rabbit,
squirrel, snake, turtle, fish
and bird were found in the
cliff dwellers&rsquo; trash mounds.</p>

<p>Today, this tree-lined creek provides a relaxing change

dweller it meant survival.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="Environs of the castle" width="800" height="276" />
</div>
<p>Archeologists suggest that this was a community of friends,
relatives, and neighbors. People going about their daily
chores&mdash;talking about the weather and the new family
next door&mdash;or inquiring into the recent death of a
newborn or elderly relative.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>This village grew and flourished for over 300 years. And
yet, when the pilgrims stepped onto Plymouth Rock in
1620, this prehistoric community had been abandoned for
over 200 years.</p>
<p>Montezuma Castle National Monument preserves only a
few of the hundreds of similar prehistoric ruins discovered
in this area.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; as it is commonly called, is a separate unit of
this National Monument. It is an area rich in cultural and
natural history.</p>
<p>Geologists suggest that the Well is a sinkhole formed by
water percolating through limestone. Warm, underground
springs supply a daily flow of 1&frac12; million gallons, and support
a pond life devoid of fish! Nearby are the fossilized remains
of irrigation ditches used to carry this water to prehistoric
farmlands. Along the Well&rsquo;s rim are the ruins of these
farmers&rsquo; homes. Today, the water from Montezuma Well
irrigates a nicely shaded picnic area abundant in bird life.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
